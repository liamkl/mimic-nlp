He was subsequently found to have\\nan left upper lobe aspergilloma which was initially treated\\nwith amphotericin, which led to the patient having seizures.\\nHe was then placed in a phenobarbital coma, which slowly\\nresolved and was started on itraconazole therapy.  Please\\nrefer to the dictation summary dictated on [**2124-1-5**],\\ndictated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].\\n\\n1.  Neurologic:  On [**2123-12-29**], the patient began\\ncomplaining of dizziness.  He did not describe a room\\nspinning sensation.  He felt like his head was falling to the\\nside, but no particular side, consistently.  He did not\\ncomplain of new numbness, weakness or tingling.  He did not\\ncomplain of dysphagia, dysarthria, hearing changes, sense of\\nfullness in the ear or headache.  He had no focal deficits on\\nexamination.\\n\\nThe patient was started on Meclizine and initially showed\\nimprovement on that.  Approximately one week after the\\nMeclizine was started, the patient was changed to a lower\\ndose of Meclizine.  After that change, the patient began\\nexperiencing dizziness again.  Subsequently, neurology was\\nconsulted on hospital day number 75.  Neurology felt that the\\npatient's dizziness was likely multi-factorial.  The cause\\nwas believed to be vestibular peripheral superimposed axial\\nand lower extremity weakness with prolonged immobility.\\n\\nAdditionally, multiple medications that the patient was\\ntaking have been associated with dizziness, including the\\npatient's seizure medications.  Neurology recommended\\nchecking a phenobarbital level.  On [**2124-1-9**], the\\nlevel was 23, which was in the therapeutic range.  Neurology\\nalso recommended considering a magnetic resonance imaging\\nscan if the patient's dizziness did not resolve or worsened.\\nAdditionally, they recommended discontinuing Reglan if the\\npatient's symptoms did not resolve and the Reglan was not\\ndeemed necessary.  The patient did not have any further\\nseizures during this hospitalization.\\n\\n2.  Infectious disease:  The issue of reverse transcript ACE\\ninhibitors was revisited within the last two weeks.  The case\\nwas discussed with infectious disease, who have been\\nfollowing the case.  At this time, they recommended holding\\non adding reverse transcript ACE inhibitors.  The patient's\\namylase level on [**2124-1-7**] was 306.  When the amylase\\nlevel returns to normal, the infectious disease service will\\nrevisit the issue of reverse transcript ACE inhibitors.\\n\\nThe patient was started on protease inhibitors on [**2123-12-26**].  According to fetal distress, the patient may stay\\non double protease inhibitor therapy for up to three months\\nbefore resistance occurs.  The plan is to revisit the issue\\nof reverse transcript ACE inhibitors once the patient's\\namylase level is within normal limits.\\n\\nOn hospital day number 73, the patient developed a 1 to 2 cm\\nulcer at the perineum.  It was mildly tender to palpation.\\nThe patient was started on acyclovir.  This also was presumed\\nto be due to herpes simplex virus type II.\\n\\n3.  Physical therapy and occupational therapy:  The patient\\ncontinued to improve over the course of the hospitalization.\\nOn discharge, the patient was able to ambulate approximately\\n200 feet with a standard walker.  The patient's lower\\nextremity strength was continuing to improve each day.  The\\npatient was also able to climb several stairs.\\n\\nDISPOSITION:  The patient will need to follow up with the\\nInfectious Disease Clinic in two to three weeks after\\ndischarge (telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**]).\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\nAcyclovir 800 mg p.o.t.i.d.\\nAmprenavir 450 mg p.o.b.i.d.\\nAzithromycin 1.2 gm p.o.q.

Infectious Disease:  The patient was spinal tapped which\\nwas not consistent with meningitis, however, he was treated\\nempirically with Ceftriaxone and noted to defervesce.\\nTherefore, Ceftriaxone was continued.  Infectious Disease\\nService was consulted.  PO acyclovir and dapsone were\\ncontinued.  KUB was obtained which was negative except for a\\nsmall amount of pelvic free fluid.  Numerous microbiology\\nstudies were sent.  The only one which was positive was a\\nsputum that grew out aspergilloses fumigatus.  Blood\\ncultures, urine cultures were negative.  Ova and parasites\\nwas negative.  Stool ova and parasites was negative.  Stool\\nculture for yersinia, Campylobacter, E. Coli, vibrio,\\ncryptococcus, Giardia were all negative.  RPR was negative.\\nSputum ova and parasites was negative.  Toxicology IgG was\\nnegative.  Cryptococcus antigen was negative.  Sputum for\\nacid fast bacilli times three were negative, however, patient\\nwas isolated respiratory until this was obtained.  The\\ncerebrospinal fluid from [**10-27**] grew one colony on one\\nplate of ..... bacterium which was .......this was thought\\nmost likely to be contaminant.  Patient was continued on\\nceftriaxone as he defervesced and remained afebrile.  Also\\ncontinued on dapsone and acyclovir, however, his white count\\nwas noted to drop and the acyclovir was decreased and then\\nstopped.  However, after stopping the acyclovir, the patient\\nnoted increase in rectal burning and the acyclovir was\\nrestarted given the patient\\'s history of herpes and the\\npatient was put on neutropenic precautions.  The patient was\\nnot restarted on HAART during this acute period as he had\\nbeen off it previously.\\n\\nOn [**10-28**], a chest CT was obtained which showed a 1.8 x\\n1.5 cm cavitary lesion in the posterior left upper lobe\\nsurrounded by consolidation and ground glass opacity, as well\\nas scattered emphysema.  The patient was started on nystatin\\nfor thrush and over the next couple of days, the diarrhea\\nseemed to resolve.  The Pulmonary Service was consulted and\\non [**11-2**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy.  BAL grew\\naspergillus fumigatus, however, it was negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]\\ncardia, ova and parasites and acid fast bacilli.  Thoracic\\nSurgery was consulted to assess whether the aspergilloma was\\nresectable.  They felt that he would need at least four to\\nsix weeks of treatment before surgery would be a\\nconsideration.  Therefore, amphotericin was started with a\\ntest dose and then at 0.5 mg /kg/IV/q.d.  Gastrointestinal\\nwas consulted given continuing abdominal pain without source,\\nheme positive, and history of skin ........and patient with\\nelevated eosinophils on his white count differential.\\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed on [**11-4**] which\\nwas noted for friability, erythema and congestion in the\\nantrum consistent with gastritis and abnormal mucosa in the\\nduodenum, but otherwise normal.  Biopsy was taken.  The\\nantrum biopsy showed chronic gastritis with focal intestinal\\nmetaplasia.  No active gastritis seen.  Duodenal biopsy\\nshowed no diagnostic abnormalities.  Patient was continued on\\nProtonix.\\n\\n2.  Gastrointestinal:  As above.  Multiple stool studies were\\nsent and all were negative.\\n\\n3.  Respiratory:  Patient found to have aspergillosis and\\nstarted on amphotericin.\\n\\n4.  Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  Patient noted to have\\na low sodium on admission of 130 felt consistent with\\nsyndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone.  This resolved\\nwith fluid restriction.\\n\\n5.  Psychiatric:  Patient continued on Paxil.  It was\\ndiscussed with the patient as to whether to have a social\\nworker or psychiatrist and he declined at that time.  On\\n[**11-9**], patient was noted to start having nausea and\\nvomiting.  After that, he was found later in the morning,\\nafter he had tried to get out of bed, next to formed stool\\nand he was unable to get up at that time.  Head CT was\\nordered but before patient was sent for head CT it was noted\\nthat his systolic blood pressure dropped to the 80s.  Patient\\nwas bolused with one liter of normal saline.  Blood pressure\\nonly responded slightly.  Medical Intensive Care Unit Team\\nwas called and was in the room at bedside.  Patient was\\nvomiting and curled on his side.  Eyelids were noted to\\nflutter and subsequently patient noted to become rigid, then\\narms came towards chest in tonic-clonic.  Patient was\\nnonresponsive.  Ativan 4 mg given and Code Team called.\\nPatient intubated for airway protection and transferred to\\nMedical Intensive Care Unit.\\n\\nIn the Medical Intensive Care Unit, patient by system:\\n\\n1.  Neurologic:  He was loaded on Dilantin.  First lumbar\\npuncture showed protein of 524. Other cultures and cytology\\nwere negative.  He was on acyclovir until HSV, PCR came back\\nnegative from cerebrospinal fluid.  MRI was negative.\\nPatient continued to have occasional gaze deviation and\\nfacial twitching, so, bedside electroencephalogram was\\nobtained which revealed seizures q. 10 minutes.  He was\\nloaded on phenobarbital.  He was still having seizures, so\\ninduced pentobarbital coma.  Neurology had been consulted.\\nElectroencephalogram flat line using pentobarbital for 72\\nhours.  During this time, he developed central diabetes\\ninsipidus, spiked fevers with negative cultures, which was\\nsuspicious for ..........dysregulation.  The second lumbar\\npuncture showed protein of 226.  Patient believed to have\\nmeningitic process, especially active in basilar regions\\ngiven central diabetes insipidus and neurogenic fevers of\\nunclear etiology. Question of whether this might be partly\\ndue to HIV encephalopathy.\\n\\nAfter three days from [**11-11**] to [**11-14**], pentobarbital\\nwas weaned to off over 24 hours, continuous\\nelectroencephalogram monitoring for 72 hours after started\\npentobarbital taper with no signs of epileptic activity on\\nelectroencephalogram.  Bedside electroencephalogram was\\ndiscontinued and patient was followed clinically.  He had\\noccasional eye twitch and facial myoclonus believed not to be\\nseizure activity.  He was maintained on phenobarbital and\\nDilantin, which will be his anti-epileptic coverage for life.\\nGoal levels are 30 for phenobarbital and 17 for Dilantin.\\nOn the fourth day after pentobarbital was off, patient noted\\nto have brain stem activity, reactive pupils and corneal\\nreflexes.  By day seven, off pentobarbital.  He became awake\\nand alert, though not interactive over the next two to three\\ndays, he became interactive and vocal after extubation,\\nalthough not at baseline mental status.  He was able to\\nfollow commands sporadically, although confused often and\\nquite exhausted.  Mental status will be impeded by his high\\nviral load and his cerebrospinal fluid.  Central diabetes\\ninsipidus resolved but he continued to have fevers, but did\\nnot seem to be infectious.  At the end of his Intensive Care\\nUnit stay, he appeared to have ICU psychosis requiring a\\nsitter and Haldol.\\n\\n2.  Pulmonary:  He was intubated for airway protection.\\nInitially acidotic during seizure that resolved quickly on\\nassist control while on pentobarbital, and then quickly\\nweaned to pressure support.  He was extubated with ease after\\nthe mental status improved and he had no problems with\\noxygenation or ventilation.  He spent 11 days on the\\nventilator during which time sputum became colonized with E.\\nColi not believed to be a pathogen, developed bilateral\\neffusion from fluid overload that resolved with diuresis.\\nBronchoscopy after mucus plug, off right upper lobe with\\ncomplete collapse.  Plug suctioned at bronchoscopy and right\\nupper lobe atelectasis resolved completely.  Left upper lobe\\naspergilloma remained unchanged per chest x-ray.  Patient was\\nmaintained on itraconazole as amphotericin had to be stopped\\nafter the seizure.\\n\\n3.  Cardiovascular:  In the beginning, patient was initially\\nseptic appearing requiring pressors.  The need for pressors\\nincreased during the pentobarbital, on dopamine and\\nvasopressin after the pentobarbital was discontinued,\\npressors easily stopped and patient had good blood pressure,\\nthereafter, echocardiogram was done while in coma with mildly\\ndepressed left ventricular function.  After, out of his coma,\\nhe had no cardiac issues.  He initially developed effusions\\nfrom fluids he received but auto drive receptor-like episode\\nresolved with resolution of the effusions.\\n\\n4.  Infectious Disease:  Dapsone prophylaxis was continued.\\nItraconazole for aspergilloma.  Initially patient on\\nceftriaxone, Levaquin, Flagyl because he looked like he might\\nhave gram negative rods sepsis, but when cultures were\\nnegative, the Levaquin and Flagyl were discontinued.  He was\\nkept on Ceftriaxone to complete a 24 day course.  He was on\\nacyclovir until HSV PCR was negative, ESBL, E. Coli and\\nsputum, but no infiltrates, so believed to be a colonizer.\\nCultures were always negative even when spiking q.d.\\nCultures were drawn q. 24-48 hours so fever thought not to be\\ninfectious.  Renal function was good throughout.  Central\\ndiabetes insipidus treated with DDAVP and matching out\\'s with\\nresolution of diabetes insipidus. In fact, DDAVP was stopped\\ncompletely because he became hyponatremic and then sodium\\nbecame normal.  Fluid status and urine osmolarity were\\nmonitored and normal saline or D5 water was given prn.\\n\\n5. Gastrointestinal:  Initial loss of bowel sounds during the\\ncoma with poor motility that improved with Reglan.  Patient\\nwas put on TPN during the coma, but after the coma, tolerated\\ntube feeds.  Patient with good bowel movement after the coma.\\nPatient stable and transferred to floor on [**2123-11-25**].\\n\\nThis will be his hospital course from [**2123-11-25**] to\\n[**2123-11-30**] by system:\\n\\n1.  Pulmonary:  Patient with aspergilloma, continued on\\nitraconazole.  02 saturations and respiratory rate remained\\nstable.  Patient remained on nasal cannula oxygen.\\n\\n2.  Infectious Disease:  Patient continued to spike fevers\\nevery day.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent.\\nBlood cultures were always negative or pending as were urine\\ncultures.  Infectious Disease consult Service continued to\\nfollow with the discussion that HAART might be started when\\nDilantin was weaned off as the two interacted and could not\\nbe started reliably concomitantly.  Another lumbar puncture\\nwas obtained for question of possible neck stiffness and\\nphotophobia.  That night, tube four had white blood cells, 8\\nred blood cells, 21 polys, 2 lymphocytes, 52 monocytes, 47 in\\ntube 1, 7 white cells, 22 red cells, no polys, 71\\nlymphocytes, 24 monocytes, protein of 46 and glucose of 67.\\nThat night, he got a dose of Ceftriaxone, however, the next\\nday with review with Infectious Disease Team, it was felt\\nthat this was not consistent with meningitis, and so,\\nCeftriaxone was stopped.  Patient was started on Levaquin for\\npossible coverage of pneumonia as he had some crackles on\\nexam.  The following day, oxacillin was also started but this\\nwas stopped after one day as LFTs were known to elevate.  At\\nthis time, no source for fevers were definitely discovered.\\nPatient with nasogastric tube, no nasal drainage or facial\\npain to palpation, however, CT at maxillary facial was\\nobtained and is pending at this time.\\n\\n3.  Neurology:  Neurology Team continued to follow the\\npatient.  Dilantin and phenobarbital levels were monitored.\\nPatient not noted to have any seizure activity.
